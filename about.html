         <p>  Sal Gambino fancied himself as a simple, hard-working man. Never in his wildest dreams would he have imagined he would be the owner of a professional football team. As a boy growing up in Bensounhurst the values of hard work and dedication were instilled in him, This eventually led to his founding and presiding over the Brooklyn Gambinos.  At only the age of 19, was Sal able to open up his own pizzeria. Sal had a space in the back of his shop where the local kids played football. It was a neighborhood fixture. In 1932 while working in his pizza shop Sal suddenly smelled smoke, and as suddenly he smelled it he was outside to investigate what was happening. He saw the first floor of building on the corner engulfed in flames. running to scene, Sal then heard cries and screams. Sal heroically grabbed a woman and a baby from the first floor before firefighters arrived. The baby became the inspiration for the famous Bambino logo. Using money he saved Bambino purchased the rights to own a team in WFL, and thus, the Brooklyn Bambinos were born.</p>
